# Clause instructions

In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake for concision.
Ask me any questions you need clarification to instead of making guesses or assumtions.

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Coding standards and convensions

- Use industry best practices and prioritize clarity, readability, maintainability, and testability.

### Testing

- Use the "Arrange, Act, Assert" pattern for unit tests. Make sure to separate the different sections with a comment.
- All tests should be deterministic and independent of each other. Avoid relying on shared state, shared mocks etc.
